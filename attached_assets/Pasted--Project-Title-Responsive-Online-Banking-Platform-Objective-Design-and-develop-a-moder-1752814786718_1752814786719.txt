**Project Title:**
Responsive Online Banking Platform

**Objective:**
Design and develop a modern, responsive online banking landing page and complete platform, including user and admin interfaces, without relying on any external services or third‑party APIs. All data storage and business logic must reside in a self‑hosted backend and database.

## 1. User‑Facing Components

### 1.1 Landing Page

* Modern, professional, mobile‑first responsive design
* Clear call‑to‑action buttons for **Sign In** and **Sign Up**
* Feature highlights (e.g., secure transfers, 24/7 support)
* Footer with links (Privacy Policy, Terms, Contact)

### 1.2 Authentication

* **Sign Up** form collecting:

  * Full Name
  * Email Address
  * Desired Username
  * Password (with strength meter)
  * Optional: Phone Number, Address
* **Sign In** form (username/email + password)
* Client‑side input validation

### 1.3 User Dashboard (Post‑Login)

* Notification banner: “Your account is under review” until approved
* Overview widgets (e.g., account summary, recent activity)
* Access to:

  * Profile settings
  * Transaction history
  * Messaging center (inbox)
* Logout button always visible

### 1.4 Messaging Center

* Real‑time chat interface between user and admin
* Display conversation history
* New message alerts
* Send/receive messages regardless of approval status

## 2. Admin‑Facing Components

### 2.1 Admin Dashboard

* Secure admin login separate from user login
* Overview panel (pending approvals, unread messages)
* User management table:

  * List all users with status (Pending, Approved, Suspended, Rejected)
  * Full view of submitted sign‑up details (including password in plaintext as per requirement)
* Activity log viewer (tracks user actions)
* Real‑time notification alerts on new sign‑ups and messages

### 2.2 User Approval Workflow

1. **Pending**: New signup appears with all form data
2. **Review**: Admin reads details, clicks **Approve**, **Reject**, or **Suspend**
3. **Notification**: System sends a detailed message to the user via the chat interface:

   * Approved: Welcome message & access granted
   * Rejected/Suspended: Explanation of reason
4. User sees status update and system notification upon next login or in chat

### 2.3 Messaging Center (Admin Side)

* Send messages to individual users at any time
* Search by user, filter by unread
* Archive or mark messages as read

## 3. Technical Requirements

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid, responsive), JavaScript
  o Optionally, a modern framework (React/Vue/Angular)

* **Backend:** Self‑hosted server (Node.js, Python, or similar)

  * RESTful or WebSocket endpoints
  * Authentication & session management

* **Database:** Local relational or document store (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB)

  * Store user profiles, messages, activity logs

* **Real‑Time Chat:** WebSocket or long‑polling implementation

* **Notifications:** In‑app banners + optional email (built via local SMTP)

* **Security:**

  * Password hashing (even if plaintext storage is displayed to admin)
  * Input sanitization
  * Secure session cookies

* **No External APIs:** All functionality—including messaging, notifications, and data storage—must be implemented locally.

## 4. User Flow Diagram

1. **Visitor** lands on the **Landing Page** → clicks **Sign Up** → fills form → submits
2. **System** creates user record with status = *Pending*
3. **Visitor** redirected to **User Dashboard** → sees “Under Review” banner
4. **Admin** receives notification → views new user in **Admin Dashboard** → reads details → chooses **Approve/Reject/Suspend**
5. **System** updates user status → sends chat message to user
6. **User** logs in again (or stays logged in) → sees status update + chat message → if approved, full features unlock; otherwise, can still log in/out and continue messaging
